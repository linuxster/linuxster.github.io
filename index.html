  <div class="entry-content">

<p>Regardless of what you might think of the ubiquity of the "Big Data" meme, it's clear that the growing size of datasets is changing the way we approach the world around us.  This is true in fields from industry to government to media to academia and virtually everywhere in between. Our increasing abilities to gather, process, visualize, and learn from large datasets is helping to push the boundaries of our knowledge.</p>
<p>But where scientific research is concerned, this recently accelerated shift to data-centric science has a dark side, which boils down to this: <strong>the skills required to be a successful scientific researcher are increasingly indistinguishable from the skills required to be successful in industry.</strong> While academia, with typical inertia, gradually shifts to accommodate this, the rest of the world has already begun to embrace and reward these skills to a much greater degree. <em>The unfortunate result is that some of the most promising upcoming researchers are finding no place for themselves in the academic community, while the for-profit world of industry stands by with deep pockets and open arms.</em>

<p>Last week, I had the privilege of attending and speaking at the
PyCon and PyData conferences in Santa Clara, CA.  As usual, there were some
amazing and inspiring talks throughout: I would highly recommend browsing
through the videos as they are put up on
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/category/33/pycon-us-2013">pyvideo</a>.</p>
<p>One thing I spent a lot of time thinking, talking, and learning about
during these two conferences was the topic of data visualization in Python.
Data visualization seemed to be everywhere: PyData had
<a href="http://sv2013.pydata.org/abstracts/#11">two</a>
<a href="http://sv2013.pydata.org/abstracts/#15">tutorials</a>
on matplotlib (the second given by yours truly), as well as a talk about
<a href="http://sv2013.pydata.org/abstracts/#41">NodeBox OpenGL</a> and a
<a href="http://sv2013.pydata.org/keynotes/#abstract_33">keynote</a> by
Fernando Perez about IPython, including the notebook and the
nice interactive data-visualization it allows. Pycon had a tutorial on
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/29/">network visualization</a>,
a talk on <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/58/">generating art</a>
in Python, and a talk on
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/108/">visualizing Github</a>. </p>

<p>One of the things I really enjoy about Python is how easy it makes it to solve
interesting problems and visualize those solutions in a compelling way. I've
done several posts on creating animations using matplotlib's relatively new
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/animation_api.html">animation toolkit</a>:
(some examples are a chaotic
<a href="/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/">double pendulum</a>,
the collisions of
<a href="/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/">particles in a box</a>,
the time-evolution of a
<a href="/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python/">quantum-mechanical wavefunction</a>,
and even a scene from the classic video game,
<a href="/blog/2013/01/13/hacking-super-mario-bros-with-python/">Super Mario Bros.</a>).</p>
<p>Recently, a reader <a href="/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/#comment-799781196">commented</a> asking whether I might do a 3D animation example.  Matplotlib
has a decent 3D toolkit called
<a href="http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/index.html">mplot3D</a>,
and though I haven't previously seen it used in conjunction with the
animation tools, there's nothing fundamental that prevents it.</p>
<p>At the commenter's suggestion, I decided to try this out with a simple
example of a chaotic system: the Lorenz equations.</p>

<p>This weekend I was coming home from the meeting of the
<a href="http://www.lsst.org">LSST</a> Dark Energy Science Collaboration,
and found myself with a few extra hours in the airport.
I started passing the time by poking around on the <a href="http://imgur.com">imgur</a>
gallery, and saw a couple animated gifs based on
one of my all-time favorite games, Super Mario Bros.
It got me wondering: could I use matplotlib's animation tools to create these
sorts of gifs in Python?  Over a few beers at an SFO bar, I started to try
to figure it out.  To spoil the punchline a bit, I managed to do it, and the
result looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/mario.gif" class="center"></p>
<p>This animation was created <em>entirely in Python and matplotlib</em>, by scraping the
image data directly from the Super Mario Bros. ROM.  Below I'll explain how
I managed to do it.</p>

<p>It's been just over four years since the introduction of Python 3, and there
are still about as many opinions on it as there are Python users.  For
those who haven't been following, Python 3 is a release
which offers several nice improvements over the 2.x series
(summarized <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html">here</a>)
with the distinct disadvantage that it broke backward compatibility:
though Python 3.x (often referred to as "Py3k" for short)
is true to the spirit of earlier Python versions,
there are a few valid 2.x constructions which will not parse under 3.x.</p>
<p>Breaking backward compatibility was controversial, to say the least.  I
think of the debate as one between the pragmatists -- those who see Python
as an extremely useful tool, which should not be unnecessarily tampered with --
and the idealists -- those who view the Python language
as a living, breathing entity, which should be allowed to grow into the
fullest and most Pythonic possible version of itself.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://fseoane.net/blog/2012/singular-value-decomposition-in-scipy/">Fabian's post</a> on the topic, I have recently returned to thinking about the
subject of sparse singular value decompositions (SVDs) in Python.</p>
<p>For those who haven't used it, the SVD is an extremely powerful technique.
It is the core routine of many applications,
from filtering to dimensionality
reduction to graph analysis to supervised classification and much, much more.</p>
<p>I first came across the need for a fast sparse SVD when applying a technique
called Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) to astronomy spectra: it was the first
astronomy paper I published, and you can read it <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AJ....138.1365V">here</a>.  In LLE, one visualizes the nonlinear relationship
between high-dimensional observations.  The computational cost is extreme: for
<em>N</em> objects, one must compute the null space (intimately related to the SVD)
of a <em>N</em> by <em>N</em> matrix.  Using direct methods (e.g. LAPACK), this can scale
as bad as $\mathcal{O}[N^3]$ in both memory and speed!</p>

<p>Lately I've been playing around with interactivity in matplotlib.  A couple
weeks ago, I discussed briefly how to use event callbacks to implement
<a href="/blog/2012/11/24/simple-3d-visualization-in-matplotlib/">simple 3D visualization</a>
and later used this as a base for creating a
<a href="/blog/2012/11/26/3d-interactive-rubiks-cube-in-python">working 3D Rubik's cube</a>
entirely in matplotlib.</p>
<p>Today I have a different goal: re-create
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_%28computer_game%29">minesweeper</a>,
that ubiquitous single-player puzzle game that most of us will admit to
having binged on at least once or twice in their lives.  In minesweeper, the
goal is to discover and avoid hidden mines within a gridded minefield, and
the process takes some logic and quick thinking.</p>
